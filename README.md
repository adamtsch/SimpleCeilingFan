# SimpleCeilingFan

A Java implementation of a Ceiling Fan with a text based input.

The Ceiling Fan has 2 pull cords:

    - There are three speeds. 
    - If it is pulled when on the 3rd speed, it will turn off the Ceiling Fan.
- Cord Two reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed if the fan is on.
